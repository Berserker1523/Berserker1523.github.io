          <h2>Videogames</h2>
          <p>When I was 5 years old, I received my first video game console, the Playstation 2. Since then, I loved videogames and their worlds. The videogames opened me more possiblities of fun and learning, like youtube videos and the curiosity of learning to code.</p>
        </button>
        <div class="videogames content">
          <p>When I haved the PS2, I liked videogames based on films and tv series, like Ben 10, Avatar, Bolt, Dragon Ball, Naruto, among others. I haved a cracked console, reason why I got hundred games.</p>
          <p>Later, when I was 10 years old, I received a Nintedo Wii for my birthday. This time buying original games, I purchased Mario Galaxy 2, The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, Super Smash Bros Brawl, among other games.</p>
          <p>After that, when I turned 12, my parents give me an Xbox 360 (and a pretty dog). My favourite games was Dark Souls, Halo 4, GTA V, Assassin's Creed.</p>
          <p>Today, because I'm in university, I purchased an laptop in order to accomplish assignments and play few games like League of Legends, Minecraft and emulations</p>

          <div class="youtube content" id="iu2">
            <p>After many years playing video games, I wanted to see how to pass difficults levels or searching for secrets. Later, I saw videos about games that I did not have, gameplays about how to improve on my games, and started following people who make my day and made me learn to be a better person.</p>

              <p>My dad started to influence me to start coding. Because in my house I did not have internet, he downloaded web pages games and gived to me disks to run them. Additionally, he had a web page. I asked him for teaching me to code, reason why he recommended me Codecademy, where I started writing code in html.</p>

            <div class="university content">
              <p>Since then, I didn't keep learning to code. But I still had interest on it. I wanted to make my own games, and I thought the power of contrinformation would be very useful to fulfill my dreams. Consequently, I chose the systems and computing engineering career.</p>

                  Previously, at school, my friends show me the world of the emulation and Pokémn games. But they didn't play original Pokémon games, they played fan games made based on official games, also known as ROM hacks. First I started playing it, later I watched gameplays about it, and finally I discovered the world of ROM Hacking and Pokémon fan games.

                <p>
                  It was in the Wack a Hack foro.

                <p>
                  At the present time, I am helping a Spain teacher to modify a game in order to his students can have fun and learn about topics of different subjects within the game.

More over, I went to an introductory talk about how to use Unreal Engine. Now, I am taking online courses on Unity game development.
